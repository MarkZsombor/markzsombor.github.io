# Portfolio/Profile Page

This is a simple single page profile page, built originally to learn Bootstrap 4 but as the project progressed it was an ideal place to learn CSS animations. The CSS is written using SASS, and the webpage is deployed using github.io at [markzsombor.github.io](markzsombor.github.io).

## TODO

Redesign for mobile. Current styling is responsive, but the site looks really boring on mobile.
